Conclusion: Positive/Negative Overview TCM Certifications: https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/ TCM Academy: https://academy.tcm-sec.com/ TCM Security A company led by Heath “TheCyberMentor” Adams, providing both training through TCM Academy and pentesting services.\nTCM Academy is the training division of TCM Security. It offers 16 different courses that can be accessed through a monthly subscription on their website.\nTheir training programs can lead to two certifications: PJPT (Practical Junior Penetration Tester), their new certification intended to “replace” eLearnSecurity’s eJPT in the long run, and its big brother, PNPT (Practical Network Penetration Tester). I completed the PNPT certification, which is the one I will discuss.\nThe course syllabus is public and can be found on the website: https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/ by clicking “Download the PNPT syllabus here.”\nTCM - Academy, reviews on courses for PNPT Course 1: Practical Ethical Hacking PEH is a good course that covers the fundamentals of note-taking, networks, Linux, Python, methodology, enumeration, exploitation, buffer overflow, Active Directory, post-exploitation, and web. While some parts are very basic, they are necessary to solidify these foundations.\nThe AD (Active Directory) section, in my opinion, is the most developed and the most useful. Everything is well explained and presented in videos by TCM in clear English, which makes the information even easier to digest. In fact, some of the attacks presented in AD are quick wins for gaining initial access and were not covered in CRTP, which assumes that you already have an account (but it goes into more depth on attacks/AD). This course was a pleasant surprise for me and provides the necessary foundations for pentesting.\nCourse 2: Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) I am not convinced by this course and I’m surprised that it is considered “mandatory” for exam success. In my opinion, it is not necessary. This is just my opinion, but OSINT is essential to “force” you to learn how to properly examine and note the information you find about site users, which should normally be part of a standard web enumeration or covered in the “External Pentest Playbook” course. Deduction and a little common sense are sufficient. HOWEVER, THE COURSE CAN BE USEFUL FOR ACTUAL PENTESTING, WHICH SHOULD BE THE GOAL FOR EVERYONE, DON’T STOP AT “PASSING THE EXAM”!!!\nCourse 3: External Pentest Playbook Basic principles, but important to implement. A good refresher on things that one might think are obvious to do but are not necessarily so. It’s quite useful, even in real-life scenarios and for reporting!\nCourses 4 and 5: Windows \u0026 Linux Privilege Escalation for Beginners Excellent training for Privilege Escalation! It’s a must-do for beginners, and to be honest, on some points, it’s more in-depth than the Privilege Escalation part of OSCP. It’s very clear, very precise, demonstrated in videos, and they make it easy to understand. It’s incredible and very comprehensive!\nHow to prepare and my preparation? Everything that’s in the exam is covered in the course! No need to do more.\nHowever, if you still want to be better prepared, the courses on TryHackMe (THM) are very good! The Jr Penetration Tester course is sufficient and covers a lot of topics. If you do it before the TCM courses, you should have enough foundation for TCM to complement and make you feel comfortable with the topics covered!\nMy only advice is to complete ALL the Capstones provided by TCM! They are important and will help you validate your knowledge, and they will even assist you in preparing for OSCP if that’s your goal.\nThe certification A “Pentest” The exam is a 5-day external pentest (and internal if you pass the external phase). Note that it’s not a CTF or an HTB (Hack The Box) challenge. The methodology taught in the course, as well as the acquired knowledge, are essential to the success of the pentest.\nTo pass the exam, the pentester must:\nperform OSINT enumerate and exploit web vulnerabilities enumerate and exploit AD vulnerabilities to pivot within the internal network compromise the Domain Controller (DC) Generally, to compromise the DC and obtain Domain Admin privileges, you need to compromise all the machines. Afterward, you will have 2 days to write the report, which is one of the most impactful components of the exam. A poorly written report can influence your certification outcome. You will also need to deliver an oral presentation to a TCM member for about fifteen minutes, which is also required for the passage, and you will usually receive your results immediately after this oral presentation. As you can see, the exam is a real pentest rather than a CTF (in addition to the differences mentioned above, there are no flags to capture).\nAn important phrase for your success is “Think outside the box.” Take breaks, reset mentally, you have time, and worst-case scenario, you have a second attempt for free with the purchase of the certification!\nPrice https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/ $300 for the voucher $400 for the voucher + the 5 courses mentioned above In both cases, you have a free re-take if you fail. Personally, I recommend the $400 option with the 5 courses if you don’t already have them. Otherwise, wait for the courses to be discounted (probably on Black Friday) and get them then. TCM often offers discounts. The value for the price is pretty cool. I’ve seen worse for less! It’s a reasonable price and worth it.\nThe exam I approached it with a somewhat carefree attitude, and I regretted it.\nIhad completed the PEH (Practical Ethical Hacking), Windows, and Linux Privilege Escalation courses a while ago, but I didn’t have time to take the certification. I went in very confident but ended up getting stuck for 3.5 days on the external phase. Even though I’m still completely surprised as to why I got stuck, and I don’t think it was intentional, it cost me a lot of time.\nOnce I reached the internal network, it was relatively smooth sailing—well, except for my some tools completely failing in the lab, which frustrated me. Apart from those two major setbacks, I enjoyed the internal phase. The attacks were cool and directly related to the course content, and everything felt incredibly realistic.\nIn hindsight, things could have gone much better, but overall, I think their environment was quite stable (except for a few cases where I might have been too hasty after a reset, and some services didn’t have enough time to load, which prevented my exploits from working).\nDon’t rely too much on your previous notes, but rather on the course materials and your knowledge. Think simple, think logically, use Google when you need more details, don’t waste too much time on rabbit holes (which are quite easy to identify), and most importantly, never give up.\nYou have 5 days, which is more than enough to ace the exam and the pentest. The report takes a bit of time to complete but is a great exercise for juniors to learn. Take the time to make it clean, well-detailed, and “easy to understand.” It will be incredibly useful for your future pentests.\nThe oral presentation is also a mandatory part, but it’s cool, no pressure. I used a PowerPoint presentation with slides showing everything I found (all the vulnerabilities I discovered, even those not exploited) as well as my path to compromising the DC. I had never done an oral presentation for a pentest before, but I wanted to simplify my explanations so that they would be understandable to anyone, regardless of their background.\nConclusion: Positive/Negative Overview Positive:\nPentest-like experience (if you think it’s like a CTF, you’ll be frustrated and waste time… like me). It’s a nice first step for a first pentest. The courses are very well explained. Responsive support on Discord if you have questions. No limitations on tools (you can use Metasploit as much as you want). The environment is fairly stable and easy to reset. No proctor: you can sleep, eat, and take the exam whenever and however you want. No camera, no one watching you. You can even take the exam in bed. But be careful, don’t cheat. Besides learning nothing, they have impressive statistics for spotting cheaters (during the debrief/report stage). No time pressure. Free re-take. Out-of-the-box thinking. If you fail but submit a report, they provide feedback and give you a hint for the step where you got stuck. Value for the price. Lifetime access to the courses once purchased (although I think they switched their pricing system between the time I’m writing this and the time I’m publishing it). Negative:\nRelatively unknown in France, but gaining recognition in the US. “Randomness”: If you’re sure about your exploit and/or path but it’s not working, reset the machine. It may not have started properly (not really their fault for that matter). The courses are not available in PDF format (no work on trains/planes/transports). No labs at TCM; the capstones are HTB/THM/Vulnhub boxes. ",

<p>The exam is a 5-day external pentest (and internal if you pass the external phase). Note that it&rsquo;s not a CTF or an HTB (Hack The Box) challenge. The methodology taught in the course, as well as the acquired knowledge, are essential to the success of the pentest.</p>
<p>To pass the exam, the pentester must:</p>
<ul>
<li>perform OSINT</li>
<li>enumerate and exploit web vulnerabilities</li>
<li>enumerate and exploit AD vulnerabilities to pivot within the internal network</li>
<li>compromise the Domain Controller (DC)
Generally, to compromise the DC and obtain Domain Admin privileges, you need to compromise all the machines.
Afterward, you will have 2 days to write the report, which is one of the most impactful components of the exam. A poorly written report can influence your certification outcome. You will also need to deliver an oral presentation to a TCM member for about fifteen minutes, which is also required for the passage, and you will usually receive your results immediately after this oral presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the exam is a real pentest rather than a CTF (in addition to the differences mentioned above, there are no flags to capture).</p>
<p>An important phrase for your success is &ldquo;Think outside the box.&rdquo; Take breaks, reset mentally, you have time, and worst-case scenario, you have a second attempt for free with the purchase of the certification!</p>
<h3 id="price">Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#price">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>    https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>$300 for the voucher</li>
<li>$400 for the voucher + the 5 courses mentioned above
In both cases, you have a free re-take if you fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I recommend the $400 option with the 5 courses if you don&rsquo;t already have them. Otherwise, wait for the courses to be discounted (probably on Black Friday) and get them then. TCM often offers discounts.
The value for the price is pretty cool. I&rsquo;ve seen worse for less! It&rsquo;s a reasonable price and worth it.</p>
<h3 id="the-exam">The exam<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-exam">#</a></h3>
<p>I approached it with a somewhat carefree attitude, and I regretted it.</p>
<p>Ihad completed the PEH (Practical Ethical Hacking), Windows, and Linux Privilege Escalation courses a while ago, but I didn&rsquo;t have time to take the certification. I went in very confident but ended up getting stuck for 3.5 days on the external phase. Even though I&rsquo;m still completely surprised as to why I got stuck, and I don&rsquo;t think it was intentional, it cost me a lot of time.</p>
<p>Once I reached the internal network, it was relatively smooth sailing—well, except for my some tools completely failing in the lab, which frustrated me. Apart from those two major setbacks, I enjoyed the internal phase. The attacks were cool and directly related to the course content, and everything felt incredibly realistic.</p>
<p>In hindsight, things could have gone much better, but overall, I think their environment was quite stable (except for a few cases where I might have been too hasty after a reset, and some services didn&rsquo;t have enough time to load, which prevented my exploits from working).</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t rely too much on your previous notes, but rather on the course materials and your knowledge. Think simple, think logically, use Google when you need more details, don&rsquo;t waste too much time on rabbit holes (which are quite easy to identify), and most importantly, never give up.</p>
<p>You have 5 days, which is more than enough to ace the exam and the pentest. The report takes a bit of time to complete but is a great exercise for juniors to learn. Take the time to make it clean, well-detailed, and &ldquo;easy to understand.&rdquo; It will be incredibly useful for your future pentests.</p>
<p>The oral presentation is also a mandatory part, but it&rsquo;s cool, no pressure. I used a PowerPoint presentation with slides showing everything I found (all the vulnerabilities I discovered, even those not exploited) as well as my path to compromising the DC. I had never done an oral presentation for a pentest before, but I wanted to simplify my explanations so that they would be understandable to anyone, regardless of their background.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-positivenegative-overview">Conclusion: Positive/Negative Overview<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion-positivenegative-overview">#</a></h2>
<p>Positive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pentest-like experience (if you think it&rsquo;s like a CTF, you&rsquo;ll be frustrated and waste time&hellip; like me). It&rsquo;s a nice first step for a first pentest.</li>
<li>The courses are very well explained.</li>
<li>Responsive support on Discord if you have questions.</li>
<li>No limitations on tools (you can use Metasploit as much as you want).</li>
<li>The environment is fairly stable and easy to reset.</li>
<li>No proctor: you can sleep, eat, and take the exam whenever and however you want. No camera, no one watching you. You can even take the exam in bed. But be careful, don&rsquo;t cheat. Besides learning nothing, they have impressive statistics for spotting cheaters (during the debrief/report stage).</li>
<li>No time pressure.</li>
<li>Free re-take.</li>
<li>Out-of-the-box thinking.</li>
<li>If you fail but submit a report, they provide feedback and give you a hint for the step where you got stuck.</li>
<li>Value for the price.</li>
<li>Lifetime access to the courses once purchased (although I think they switched their pricing system between the time I&rsquo;m writing this and the time I&rsquo;m publishing it).</li>
</ul>
<p>Negative:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relatively unknown in France, but gaining recognition in the US.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Randomness&rdquo;: If you&rsquo;re sure about your exploit and/or path but it&rsquo;s not working, reset the machine. It may not have started properly (not really their fault for that matter).</li>
<li>The courses are not available in PDF format (no work on trains/planes/transports).</li>
<li>No labs at TCM; the capstones are HTB/THM/Vulnhub boxes.</li>
</ul>
