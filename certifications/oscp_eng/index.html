  "articleBody": " 1. OffSec - Offensive Security 1.1 Overview of the course / summary \u0026 the 10 bonus points 1.2. A well-established methodology 1.3. Stress (24 hours, $1600, “many people don’t pass it”, 3 months) 2. How to (very) well prepare \u0026 my preparation? 3. The certification 3.1 Price 3.2 The exam 4. Conclusion: Positive / negative overview OffSec - Offensive Security A well-known company, one of the leaders in the most renowned cybersecurity training and certifications.\nThey offer a wide range of training and certifications for all levels and areas of cybersecurity at a significant price. However, their training and certifications are highly recognized worldwide and often help bypass the HR filter.\nWhen starting in offensive cybersecurity, you are undoubtedly aware of the holy grail known as OSCP for HRs. I will talk about this certification and its PEN-200 course, which can be seen as a milestone in offensive cybersecurity. But in reality, it is just the beginning of a long tunnel whose end you may never see, especially if you are passionate about offensive security and “pentesting” is not a final goal but a step towards improvement.\nOverview of the course / summary \u0026 the 10 bonus points The course provided with OSCP is PEN-200, which provides the necessary knowledge to pass the exam. It teaches you the use of tools as well as the theory necessary to understand the attacks and techniques used. Each topic consists of several chapters, and each chapter has its own exercise labs related to what they teach.\nThe course is also accompanied by explanatory videos if the course content is not sufficient.\nYou can find the topics covered in the syllabus:\nhttps://www.offsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pen-200-pwk-syllabus.pdf In summary, the course covers introduction to cybersecurity, methodology cycle, enumeration (services, web, AD…), exploitation (exploits, SQL injection…), privilege escalation (Windows and Linux, manual and automatic), post-exploitation, lateral movements, tunneling, and shells.\nIn my opinion, the course is relatively simple if you have some background in cybersecurity. It does not go very deep, and its purpose is not to make you a zero-day POC expert but to teach you the basics to become operational. Completing the THM and TCM courses (especially on privilege escalation) is highly recommended as a good complement or foundation before or after the OSCP course (considering its price, you wouldn’t want to miss it).\nAfter preparing and taking the exam, I was disappointed with the course. I went overkill, thinking it would be very challenging based on the certification’s reputation. But that’s just my opinion, and it may differ from others. OSCP is not that difficult; it is entry-level for pentesting. What sets it apart from other certifications is not its course content but its recognition among companies and HRs.\nThe course and the training labs have been recently upgraded (PEN-200 2023), which provides additional assistance and support for the certification. You may have heard about it or read about it in other blogs, but the previous OSCP version included Buffer Overflow and a large training lab with around 70 machines.\nPeople who take the OSCP exam, let’s be honest, aim to acquire knowledge and showcase it to companies by successfully passing the certification. The Buffer Overflow is no longer included; now you have an obligatory AD component. The previous extensive lab has been replaced with three “medium” labs (around ten machines each) and three OSCP-Like labs with three standalone machines and an AD. This new training lab helps even more in preparing for OSCP and allows potential testing in a real-like scenario. By completing an OSCP-Like lab in 24 hours, you can simulate exam-like conditions. This is one of the main reasons why I find this new lab much more appealing than the previous one. It’s worth mentioning that OffSec recommends completing two of the “medium” labs (the last one being a bit out-of-scope according to them) and all three OSCP-Like labs before taking the exam.\nIn addition to this new lab, OffSec has changed the rules for earning the 10 bonus points. Now, you must achieve at least 80% in each of the 26 (or 25?) topics, including exercises, and complete a minimum of 30 machines in the training lab.\nFor more details, refer to the OSCP Exam FAQ:\nhttps://help.offsec.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412170923924-OSCP-Exam-FAQ#h_01FP8BXRYRTQM6QKB9FPH2FQM7 A well-established methodology One of the most important aspects you learn is the methodology and the rigor in its application. The key to success is a well-established methodology that covers every possible aspect you may encounter in a target. Understanding and internalizing the methodology that OffSec tries to impart through training labs, exercises, and the course itself is crucial for exam success. Once you have learned it, understanding what OffSec expects from you becomes simple, and the elements will fall into place logically. This will also help you navigate through any potential rabbit holes and make you more comfortable during the exam.\nThere is a basic cycle to follow: enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, post-exploitation, and then repeating from enumeration to potentially perform lateral movements. This is the “basic” method, but each individual may have their own variations and additions for each step. OffSec provides you with the foundation, but it’s up to you to complement it to ensure you don’t miss anything. Having confidence in your methodology, refining it, and ensuring it covers all necessary aspects for both boxes and the OSCP exam are crucial.\nStress (24 hours, $1600, “many people don’t pass it”, 3 months) One of the most significant factors leading to failure is stress. Some may argue that time is the main issue, but the two are correlated. If you manage your stress well, you will have a clearer mind and know what to do when you get stuck. You will know when to take breaks, reset mentally, start afresh, prioritize, and so on.\nIt’s important not to rely solely on internet opinions and reviews. They can serve as a starting point, but remember that each person is different. Everyone has their own methodology and may feel ready at one point, but perhaps not for someone else. Each individual is unique, so there’s no point in comparing yourself to others. Succeeding or failing at OSCP does not make you a better or worse pentester, nor does it mean you are better or worse than anyoneelse. Each person approaches the exam differently. Three months is a sufficient timeframe for successfully completing the exam if you have taken the necessary precautions. Investing €1534 in a certification means you wouldn’t want to miss it (even though the retake fee is $250 instead of $1600, thankfully).\nThe best way to succeed is to develop a solid methodology, create a study plan, stay organized, and maintain a consistent work schedule. Working consistently each day is better than cramming all at once. It may take as long as it needs to, but going through intermediate steps can help build your confidence.\nHow to (very) well prepare \u0026 my preparation? You may not have the means to access HTB + THM + PGP + HTB Pro Lab + OSCP, hence the “optional” presence. Here’s my recommended way to prepare (very well):\nJr Learning Penetration Tester on THM Windows \u0026 Linux Privilege Escalation on TCM (optional but highly appreciated) At least 20 Linux machines and 10-15 Windows machines from TJNull’s list (HTB) (optional since, in my opinion, PGP is closer to OSCP than HTB, especially considering that some machines in PGP are former machines from OSCP sets) At least 20 machines (Windows/Linux) from TJNull’s OffSec Playground Practice list HackTheBox Pro Lab: Dante (optional) OSCP course (PEN-200) in its entirety More than 30 machines in the OSCP training lab, including the 3 OSCP-Like labs to simulate real exam conditions Take notes as you go (Obsidian, Notion, etc.) to refine and develop your methodology. (#Add screenshots of my notes) Here’s my preparation journey (from 0 to OSCP):\nIntroduction to Cyber Security - THM Web Fundamentals - THM Jr Learning Penetration Tester - THM CompTIA Pentest+ Learning Path - THM Offensive Pentesting - THM (Only completed half, around 50%) eJPT (a first step into certification, just to get a sense of it) Dante Pro Lab - HTB (14 machines) Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP) - Altered Security (overkill) Offshore Pro Lab - HTB (17 machines) (overkill) PEH, Windows Privilege Escalation, Linux Privilege Escalation - TCM Security Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) - TCM Security (different, optional) Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) - OffSec There are, of course, various boxes between each of these steps:\n~~45 HTB boxes ~~25 PGP boxes Totaling around 70 boxes plus the two pro labs, making it around 100 boxes in total. In parallel with these boxes, I also engaged in numerous discussions and attended Hack The Box France meetups where speakers presented OSCP-like boxes or gave talks every two weeks on Thursday evenings.\nFrance Meetup Link : https://www.meetup.com/hack-the-box-meetup-france/ There should be the same for other countries, look for it !\nIt was largely thanks to these speakers, their presentations, and their dedication to the community that I was able to develop my knowledge, skills, and refine my methodology to pass OSCP.\nShoutout to Euz (Matthieu Billaux), LaBrute, mudpak (zebi zebi), Wem, who manage the HTB FR Discord and the meetup community, as well as all the speakers!\nThe certification Unlike PNPT, in my opinion, this certification is more CTF-like. The exam itself consists of 6 machines: 3 standalones and 1 AD (3 machines). The standalones closely resemble HTB/PGP boxes, so training on those platforms is very helpful and important. The methodology you learn during the course will guide you through each step, the path to follow, and their logic. To pass the exam, you need to accumulate a total of 70 points within 24 hours and submit your report within 24 hours after the exam.\nThe grading system is as follows:\nStandalones: User flag is worth 10 points (local.txt), and root flag is also worth 10 points (proof.txt), totaling 20 points per standalone. AD: Full compromise (being Domain Admin) gives 40 points; otherwise, it’s 0 points (no partial points). Additionally, earning the bonus points (finishing the exercises of each topic with at least 80% completion) grants 10 bonus points, which are highly valuable.\nThere are two ways to achieve the 70 points:\n1 AD (40 pts) + 1 full standalone (user = 10 points, root = 10 points) (optional if you have the bonus points: + 1 user on another standalone (10 pts)) = 70 pts. 3 standalones (60 points) + 10 bonus points from exercises = 70 points. In my opinion, it is highly recommended to aim for the first case rather than the second. You will be more comfortable and less stressed once you have completed the AD, as you will be very close to the required points for passing the exam.\nAt the end of the exam, you will need to submit a report, which also determines your success. Without a report, regardless of the number of points you earned, you won’t obtain the OSCP certification. However, don’t worry, as you just need to follow OffSec’s report template and the instructions provided in the course regarding reports. Everything covered in the exam is included in the course content; there are no new knowledge areas. Take breaks when needed, and remember that 24 hours are sufficient if you areadequately prepared. Rigor and methodology are the keys to success.\nPrice Offsec’s website https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/ provides detailed pricing information:\n$1600 for 3 months of lab access and course materials. $2500 for 1 year of lab access and course materials. $250 for a retake. Personally, I believe that 3 months is sufficient if you have prepared well in advance.\nThe Exam Honestly, with the OSCP-like training labs and the feedback I received from people around me, I was very confident. My exam was scheduled at my usual time: 10:00 AM. I woke up, went through my regular routine, played a game of LoL, and then got ready for my exam (I tested my setup the day before, camera, etc. They provide test credentials if you ask for them). I logged in at 9:45 AM, went through the verification and identification process, and received my VPN and everything needed at 10:11 AM. Then, I started the exam. Thanks to all the training, labs, and boxes I had completed, I was able to progress very quickly:\nAD: Started at 10:11 AM -\u003e Finished at 11:10 AM ~ Took a bathroom break during the scanning process. Machine 1: Started at 11:15 AM -\u003e Finished at 12:15 PM ~ Took a lunch break. Machine 2: Started at 1:00 PM -\u003e Finished at 1:45 PM ~ Took a bathroom break. Machine 3: Started at 2:00 PM -\u003e Finished at 3:00 PM. The time taken varies for each individual. After completing everything, I went back to each machine to capture clean screenshots and write my report simultaneously. Capturing all the necessary screens, highlighting important elements, and gradually inserting them into the report took me around 5 hours.\nI was lucky not to fall into rabbit holes and to quickly identify the paths (thanks to HTB/PGP and all the training).\nIf you get stuck, don’t hesitate to take a break. Seriously, eat something, go outside for a bit. It helps reset your mind and break out of a cycle that may be hindering you. Remember what OffSec expects from you, keep the methodology in mind, and be disciplined. You also have the option to try other machines and come back to the one you’re stuck on later. Successfully completing a machine will give you a confidence boost (especially the AD) and significantly reduce your stress, making you more comfortable for the rest of the exam.\nMy main goal is to demystify this certification and make you aware that with rigor, methodology, and training, it is very achievable (despite its high price).\nConclusion: Positive/Negative Overview Positive aspects:\nThe courses are well-explained, detailed, and accompanied by videos. Responsive support on Discord for any questions you may have. Student Mentors available in the channels to answer course-related questions. Highly recognized by companies (bypassing HR filters, haha). Exam environment is relatively stable and easy to reset (though be cautious of potential services that may take time to start). You can request the course in PDF format (allows for offline studying during flights, train rides, or when there’s no network connectivity). Methodology becomes ingrained in your mind. Some old OSCP labs are available in OffSec’s Playground Practice. Negative aspects:\nThe certification is for pentesting but feels very CTF-like. Limitations on certain tools (unclear why). Highly stressful (24 hours, expensive, etc.). Questionable value for money compared to other certifications. Randomness factor: if you’re certain about your exploit or path but it’s not working, reset the machine; it may not have booted correctly (not really OffSec’s fault for this one). Instability of the course environment (personally, I experienced machines in the course that took 5 minutes to boot and 5 minutes to stop, you can imagine the slowness. I believe it’s now fixed and takes around 15-30 seconds, but there’s often downtime for such an expensive certification, which is disappointing). ",

<p>A well-known company, one of the leaders in the most renowned cybersecurity training and certifications.</p>
<p>They offer a wide range of training and certifications for all levels and areas of cybersecurity at a significant price. However, their training and certifications are highly recognized worldwide and often help bypass the HR filter.</p>
<p>When starting in offensive cybersecurity, you are undoubtedly aware of the holy grail known as OSCP for HRs. I will talk about this certification and its PEN-200 course, which can be seen as a milestone in offensive cybersecurity. But in reality, it is just the beginning of a long tunnel whose end you may never see, especially if you are passionate about offensive security and &ldquo;pentesting&rdquo; is not a final goal but a step towards improvement.</p>
<h3 id="overview-of-the-course--summary--the-10-bonus-points">Overview of the course / summary &amp; the 10 bonus points<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#overview-of-the-course--summary--the-10-bonus-points">#</a></h3>
<p>The course provided with OSCP is PEN-200, which provides the necessary knowledge to pass the exam. It teaches you the use of tools as well as the theory necessary to understand the attacks and techniques used. Each topic consists of several chapters, and each chapter has its own exercise labs related to what they teach.</p>
<p>The course is also accompanied by explanatory videos if the course content is not sufficient.</p>
<p>You can find the topics covered in the syllabus:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.offsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pen-200-pwk-syllabus.pdf
</code></pre>
<p>In summary, the course covers introduction to cybersecurity, methodology cycle, enumeration (services, web, AD&hellip;), exploitation (exploits, SQL injection&hellip;), privilege escalation (Windows and Linux, manual and automatic), post-exploitation, lateral movements, tunneling, and shells.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the course is relatively simple if you have some background in cybersecurity. It does not go very deep, and its purpose is not to make you a zero-day POC expert but to teach you the basics to become operational. Completing the THM and TCM courses (especially on privilege escalation) is highly recommended as a good complement or foundation before or after the OSCP course (considering its price, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to miss it).</p>
<p>After preparing and taking the exam, I was disappointed with the course. I went overkill, thinking it would be very challenging based on the certification&rsquo;s reputation. But that&rsquo;s just my opinion, and it may differ from others. OSCP is not that difficult; it is entry-level for pentesting. What sets it apart from other certifications is not its course content but its recognition among companies and HRs.</p>
<p>The course and the training labs have been recently upgraded (PEN-200 2023), which provides additional assistance and support for the certification. You may have heard about it or read about it in other blogs, but the previous OSCP version included Buffer Overflow and a large training lab with around 70 machines.</p>
<p>People who take the OSCP exam, let&rsquo;s be honest, aim to acquire knowledge and showcase it to companies by successfully passing the certification. The Buffer Overflow is no longer included; now you have an obligatory AD component. The previous extensive lab has been replaced with three &ldquo;medium&rdquo; labs (around ten machines each) and three OSCP-Like labs with three standalone machines and an AD. This new training lab helps even more in preparing for OSCP and allows potential testing in a real-like scenario. By completing an OSCP-Like lab in 24 hours, you can simulate exam-like conditions. This is one of the main reasons why I find this new lab much more appealing than the previous one. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that OffSec recommends completing two of the &ldquo;medium&rdquo; labs (the last one being a bit out-of-scope according to them) and all three OSCP-Like labs before taking the exam.</p>
<p>In addition to this new lab, OffSec has changed the rules for earning the 10 bonus points. Now, you must achieve at least 80% in each of the 26 (or 25?) topics, including exercises, and complete a minimum of 30 machines in the training lab.</p>

<h3 id="a-well-established-methodology">A well-established methodology<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-well-established-methodology">#</a></h3>
<p>One of the most important aspects you learn is the methodology and the rigor in its application. The key to success is a well-established methodology that covers every possible aspect you may encounter in a target. Understanding and internalizing the methodology that OffSec tries to impart through training labs, exercises, and the course itself is crucial for exam success. Once you have learned it, understanding what OffSec expects from you becomes simple, and the elements will fall into place logically. This will also help you navigate through any potential rabbit holes and make you more comfortable during the exam.</p>
<p>There is a basic cycle to follow: enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, post-exploitation, and then repeating from enumeration to potentially perform lateral movements. This is the &ldquo;basic&rdquo; method, but each individual may have their own variations and additions for each step. OffSec provides you with the foundation, but it&rsquo;s up to you to complement it to ensure you don&rsquo;t miss anything. Having confidence in your methodology, refining it, and ensuring it covers all necessary aspects for both boxes and the OSCP exam are crucial.</p>
<h3 id="stress-24-hours-1600-many-people-dont-pass-it-3-months">Stress (24 hours, $1600, &ldquo;many people don&rsquo;t pass it&rdquo;, 3 months)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#stress-24-hours-1600-many-people-dont-pass-it-3-months">#</a></h3>
<p>One of the most significant factors leading to failure is stress. Some may argue that time is the main issue, but the two are correlated. If you manage your stress well, you will have a clearer mind and know what to do when you get stuck. You will know when to take breaks, reset mentally, start afresh, prioritize, and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important not to rely solely on internet opinions and reviews. They can serve as a starting point, but remember that each person is different. Everyone has their own methodology and may feel ready at one point, but perhaps not for someone else. Each individual is unique, so there&rsquo;s no point in comparing yourself to others. Succeeding or failing at OSCP does not make you a better or worse pentester, nor does it mean you are better or worse than anyoneelse. Each person approaches the exam differently. Three months is a sufficient timeframe for successfully completing the exam if you have taken the necessary precautions. Investing €1534 in a certification means you wouldn&rsquo;t want to miss it (even though the retake fee is $250 instead of $1600, thankfully).</p>
<p>The best way to succeed is to develop a solid methodology, create a study plan, stay organized, and maintain a consistent work schedule. Working consistently each day is better than cramming all at once. It may take as long as it needs to, but going through intermediate steps can help build your confidence.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-very-well-prepare--my-preparation">How to (very) well prepare &amp; my preparation?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-very-well-prepare--my-preparation">#</a></h2>
<p>You may not have the means to access HTB + THM + PGP + HTB Pro Lab + OSCP, hence the &ldquo;optional&rdquo; presence.
Here&rsquo;s my recommended way to prepare (very well):</p>
<ul>
<li>Jr Learning Penetration Tester on THM</li>
<li>Windows &amp; Linux Privilege Escalation on TCM (optional but highly appreciated)</li>
<li>At least 20 Linux machines and 10-15 Windows machines from TJNull&rsquo;s list (HTB) (optional since, in my opinion, PGP is closer to OSCP than HTB, especially considering that some machines in PGP are former machines from OSCP sets)</li>
<li>At least 20 machines (Windows/Linux) from TJNull&rsquo;s OffSec Playground Practice list</li>
<li>HackTheBox Pro Lab: Dante (optional)</li>
<li>OSCP course (PEN-200) in its entirety</li>
<li>More than 30 machines in the OSCP training lab, including the 3 OSCP-Like labs to simulate real exam conditions</li>
<li>Take notes as you go (Obsidian, Notion, etc.) to refine and develop your methodology. (#Add screenshots of my notes)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my preparation journey (from 0 to OSCP):</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to Cyber Security - THM</li>
<li>Web Fundamentals - THM</li>
<li>Jr Learning Penetration Tester - THM</li>
<li>CompTIA Pentest+ Learning Path - THM</li>
<li>Offensive Pentesting - THM (Only completed half, around 50%)</li>
<li>eJPT (a first step into certification, just to get a sense of it)</li>
<li>Dante Pro Lab - HTB (14 machines)</li>
<li>Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP) - Altered Security (overkill)</li>
<li>Offshore Pro Lab - HTB (17 machines) (overkill)</li>
<li>PEH, Windows Privilege Escalation, Linux Privilege Escalation - TCM Security</li>
<li>Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) - TCM Security (different, optional)</li>
<li>Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) - OffSec</li>
</ul>
<p>There are, of course, various boxes between each of these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>~~45 HTB boxes</li>
<li>~~25 PGP boxes
Totaling around 70 boxes plus the two pro labs, making it around 100 boxes in total.</li>
</ul>
<p>In parallel with these boxes, I also engaged in numerous discussions and attended Hack The Box France meetups where speakers presented OSCP-like boxes or gave talks every two weeks on Thursday evenings.</p>
<p>France Meetup Link : <a href="https://www.meetup.com/hack-the-box-meetup-france/">https://www.meetup.com/hack-the-box-meetup-france/</a>
There should be the same for other countries, look for it !</p>
<p>It was largely thanks to these speakers, their presentations, and their dedication to the community that I was able to develop my knowledge, skills, and refine my methodology to pass OSCP.</p>
<p>Shoutout to Euz (Matthieu Billaux), LaBrute, mudpak (zebi zebi), Wem, who manage the HTB FR Discord and the meetup community, as well as all the speakers!</p>
<h2 id="the-certification">The certification<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-certification">#</a></h2>
<p>Unlike PNPT, in my opinion, this certification is more CTF-like. The exam itself consists of 6 machines: 3 standalones and 1 AD (3 machines). The standalones closely resemble HTB/PGP boxes, so training on those platforms is very helpful and important. The methodology you learn during the course will guide you through each step, the path to follow, and their logic. To pass the exam, you need to accumulate a total of 70 points within 24 hours and submit your report within 24 hours after the exam.</p>
<p>The grading system is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standalones: User flag is worth 10 points (local.txt), and root flag is also worth 10 points (proof.txt), totaling 20 points per standalone.</li>
<li>AD: Full compromise (being Domain Admin) gives 40 points; otherwise, it&rsquo;s 0 points (no partial points).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, earning the bonus points (finishing the exercises of each topic with at least 80% completion) grants 10 bonus points, which are highly valuable.</p>
<p>There are two ways to achieve the 70 points:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 AD (40 pts) + 1 full standalone (user = 10 points, root = 10 points) (optional if you have the bonus points: + 1 user on another standalone (10 pts)) = 70 pts.</li>
<li>3 standalones (60 points) + 10 bonus points from exercises = 70 points.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, it is highly recommended to aim for the first case rather than the second. You will be more comfortable and less stressed once you have completed the AD, as you will be very close to the required points for passing the exam.</p>
<p>At the end of the exam, you will need to submit a report, which also determines your success. Without a report, regardless of the number of points you earned, you won&rsquo;t obtain the OSCP certification. However, don&rsquo;t worry, as you just need to follow OffSec&rsquo;s report template and the instructions provided in the course regarding reports. Everything covered in the exam is included in the course content; there are no new knowledge areas. Take breaks when needed, and remember that 24 hours are sufficient if you areadequately prepared. Rigor and methodology are the keys to success.</p>
<h3 id="price">Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#price">#</a></h3>
<p>Offsec&rsquo;s website
<a href="https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/">https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/</a>
provides detailed pricing information:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1600 for 3 months of lab access and course materials.</li>
<li>$2500 for 1 year of lab access and course materials.</li>
<li>$250 for a retake.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I believe that 3 months is sufficient if you have prepared well in advance.</p>
<h3 id="the-exam">The Exam<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-exam">#</a></h3>
<p>Honestly, with the OSCP-like training labs and the feedback I received from people around me, I was very confident. My exam was scheduled at my usual time: 10:00 AM. I woke up, went through my regular routine, played a game of LoL, and then got ready for my exam (I tested my setup the day before, camera, etc. They provide test credentials if you ask for them).
I logged in at 9:45 AM, went through the verification and identification process, and received my VPN and everything needed at 10:11 AM. Then, I started the exam. Thanks to all the training, labs, and boxes I had completed, I was able to progress very quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li>AD: Started at 10:11 AM -&gt; Finished at 11:10 AM ~ Took a bathroom break during the scanning process.</li>
<li>Machine 1: Started at 11:15 AM -&gt; Finished at 12:15 PM ~ Took a lunch break.</li>
<li>Machine 2: Started at 1:00 PM -&gt; Finished at 1:45 PM ~ Took a bathroom break.</li>
<li>Machine 3: Started at 2:00 PM -&gt; Finished at 3:00 PM.</li>
</ul>
<p>The time taken varies for each individual. After completing everything, I went back to each machine to capture clean screenshots and write my report simultaneously. Capturing all the necessary screens, highlighting important elements, and gradually inserting them into the report took me around 5 hours.</p>
<p>I was lucky not to fall into rabbit holes and to quickly identify the paths (thanks to HTB/PGP and all the training).</p>
<p>If you get stuck, don&rsquo;t hesitate to take a break. Seriously, eat something, go outside for a bit. It helps reset your mind and break out of a cycle that may be hindering you. Remember what OffSec expects from you, keep the methodology in mind, and be disciplined. You also have the option to try other machines and come back to the one you&rsquo;re stuck on later. Successfully completing a machine will give you a confidence boost (especially the AD) and significantly reduce your stress, making you more comfortable for the rest of the exam.</p>
<p>My main goal is to demystify this certification and make you aware that with rigor, methodology, and training, it is very achievable (despite its high price).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-positivenegative-overview">Conclusion: Positive/Negative Overview<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion-positivenegative-overview">#</a></h2>
<p>Positive aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The courses are well-explained, detailed, and accompanied by videos.</li>
<li>Responsive support on Discord for any questions you may have.</li>
<li>Student Mentors available in the channels to answer course-related questions.</li>
<li>Highly recognized by companies (bypassing HR filters, haha).</li>
<li>Exam environment is relatively stable and easy to reset (though be cautious of potential services that may take time to start).</li>
<li>You can request the course in PDF format (allows for offline studying during flights, train rides, or when there&rsquo;s no network connectivity).</li>
<li>Methodology becomes ingrained in your mind.</li>
<li>Some old OSCP labs are available in OffSec&rsquo;s Playground Practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Negative aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The certification is for pentesting but feels very CTF-like.</li>
<li>Limitations on certain tools (unclear why).</li>
<li>Highly stressful (24 hours, expensive, etc.).</li>
<li>Questionable value for money compared to other certifications.</li>
<li>Randomness factor: if you&rsquo;re certain about your exploit or path but it&rsquo;s not working, reset the machine; it may not have booted correctly (not really OffSec&rsquo;s fault for this one).</li>
<li>Instability of the course environment (personally, I experienced machines in the course that took 5 minutes to boot and 5 minutes to stop, you can imagine the slowness. I believe it&rsquo;s now fixed and takes around 15-30 seconds, but there&rsquo;s often downtime for such an expensive certification, which is disappointing).</li>
</ul>
